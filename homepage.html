<p>Additionally, the IIA syllabus gives guidance for the depth to which you must know the topics. There are two levels:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="1"><strong>Proficiency </strong>- Candidates must exhibit proficiency (thorough understanding and ability to apply concepts).&nbsp;</li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="1"><strong>Awareness </strong>- Candidates must exhibit awareness (knowledge of terminology and fundamentals).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Sections I and III are tested at the Proficiency Level and Section II is tested at the Awareness Level.</p>
<p>In preparing for the exam, you should read the textbook and use the study bank and practice exams to review questions from past exams. Many of the exam topics are very large and by studying past exam questions you can get a feeling for the manner and depth to which a topic has been tested.</p>
