<p>This Section focuses on <strong>controls</strong> and the processes that help organizations achieve their goals and objectives.

<ul>
<li>Reliability and integrity of financial and operating information &nbsp;</li>
<li>Efficiency and effectiveness of operations&nbsp;</li>
<li>Safeguarding of assets&nbsp;</li>
<li>Compliance with laws, regulations, and contracts&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
