</div>
<p>The number of accounting scandals around the world has put the spotlight on the importance of ethics and ethical behavior in companies and the business community. Business ethics is driven by the culture created by a company&rsquo;s management, and thus it has a direct impact on investor confidence. Good business ethics promotes good business practices and ultimately has a positive impact on the bottom line. Similarly, a bad ethical environment will have a negative impact on business practices, which in turn will adversely affect the company&rsquo;s profits.</p>
<p>The internal audit activity provides an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve operations. Therefore, the IIA&rsquo;s Code of Ethics is intended to be the ethical guide of conduct for internal auditors. You need to be familiar with the Code of Ethics and how the different terms and ideals relate to different circumstances. For the exam, you need to be able to apply the IIA Code of Ethics to the different situations that are presented.</p>

<p style="color: #374151; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 16px 0; line-height: 1.7;">The Code of Ethics states the principles and expectations governing the behavior of individuals and organizations in the conduct of internal auditing. It describes the minimum requirements for conduct, and behavioral expectations rather than specific activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction to the Code of Ethics</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of The Institute's Code of Ethics is to promote an ethical culture in the profession of internal auditing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization&rsquo;s operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A code of ethics is necessary and appropriate for the profession of internal auditing, founded as it is on the trust placed in its objective assurance about governance, risk management, and control.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Institute&rsquo;s Code of Ethics extends beyond the Definition of Internal Auditing to include two essential components:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="1">Principles that are relevant to the profession and practice of internal auditing.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="1">Rules of Conduct that describe behavior norms expected of internal auditors. These rules are an aid to interpreting the Principles into practical applications and are intended to guide the ethical conduct of internal auditors.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;Internal auditors&rdquo; refers to Institute members, recipients of or candidates for IIA professional certifications, and those who perform internal audit services within the Definition of Internal Auditing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Applicability and Enforcement of the Code of Ethics</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Code of Ethics applies to both entities and individuals that perform internal audit services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For IIA members and recipients of or candidates for IIA professional certifications, breaches of the Code of Ethics will be evaluated and administered according to The Institute&rsquo;s Bylaws and Administrative Directives. The fact that a particular conduct is not mentioned in the Rules of Conduct does not prevent it from being unacceptable or discreditable, and therefore, the member, certification holder, or candidate can be liable for disciplinary action.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Principles</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Internal auditors are expected to apply and uphold the following principles:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Integrity - </strong>The integrity of internal auditors establishes trust and thus provides the basis for reliance on their judgment.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Objectivity - </strong>Internal auditors exhibit the highest level of professional objectivity in gathering, evaluating, and communicating information about the activity or process being examined. Internal auditors make a balanced assessment of all the relevant circumstances and are not unduly influenced by their own interests or by others in forming judgments.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Confidentiality - </strong>Internal auditors respect the value and ownership of information they receive and do not disclose information without appropriate authority unless there is a legal or professional obligation to do so.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Competency - </strong>Internal auditors apply the knowledge, skills, and experience needed in the performance of internal auditing services.</li>
</ol>
