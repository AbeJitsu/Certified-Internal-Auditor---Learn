</div>
<p>The following text is taken directly from the IIA. This is an excellent outline of the <em>Standards</em> and the objectives of the <em>Standards</em>.</p>
<h3>Standards and Objectives</h3>
<p>Internal auditing is conducted in diverse legal and cultural environments; within organizations that vary in purpose, size, complexity, and structure; and by persons within or outside the organization. While differences may affect the practice of internal auditing in each environment, conformance with The IIA&rsquo;s <em>International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing</em><em> (Standards)</em> is essential in meeting the responsibilities of internal auditors and the internal audit activity.</p>
<p>If internal auditors or the internal audit activity is prohibited by law or regulation from conformance with certain parts of the <em>Standards</em>, conformance with all other parts of the <em>Standards</em><em> </em>and appropriate disclosures are needed.</p>
<p>If the <em>Standards </em>are used in conjunction with standards issued by other authoritative bodies, internal audit communications may also cite the use of other standards, as appropriate. In such a case, if inconsistencies exist between the <em>Standards </em>and other standards, internal auditors and the internal audit activity must conform with the <em>Standards</em>, and may conform with the other standards if they are more restrictive.</p>
<p>The purpose of the <em>Standards </em>is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delineate basic principles that represent the practice of internal auditing.</li>
<li>Provide a framework for performing and promoting a broad range of value-added internal auditing.</li>
<li>Establish the basis for the evaluation of internal audit performance.</li>
<li>Foster improved organizational processes and operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Standards</em> are principles-focused, mandatory requirements consisting of:</p>
<p><strong>Statements of basic requirements</strong> for the professional practice of internal auditing and for evaluating the effectiveness of performance, which are internationally applicable at organizational and individual levels.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretations</strong>, which clarify terms or concepts within the Statements.</p>
<p>The <em>Standards </em>employ terms that have been given specific meanings that are included in the Glossary. Specifically, the <em>Standards </em>use the word "must" to specify an unconditional requirement and the word "should" where conformance is expected unless, when applying professional judgment, circumstances justify deviation.</p>
<p>It is necessary to consider the Statements and their Interpretations as well as the specific meanings from the Glossary to understand and apply the <em>Standards </em>correctly.</p>
<p class="-bg-tint -p20 -quote">The structure of the <em>Standards </em>is divided between Attribute and Performance <em>Standards</em>. <strong>Attribute <em>Standards</em></strong><em> </em>address the attributes of organizations and individuals performing internal auditing. The <strong>Performance <em>Standards</em></strong> describe the nature of internal auditing and provide quality criteria against which the performance of these services can be measured. The Attribute and Performance <em>Standards </em>are also provided to apply to all internal audit services.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation <em>Standards</em></strong><em> </em>are also provided to expand upon the Attribute and Performance <em>Standards</em>, by providing the requirements applicable to assurance (A) or consulting (C) activities.</p>
<p><strong>Assurance services</strong> involve the internal auditor&rsquo;s objective assessment of evidence to provide an independent opinion or conclusions regarding an entity, operation, function, process, system, or other subject matter. The nature and scope of the assurance engagement are determined by the internal auditor. There are generally three parties involved in assurance services: (1) the person or group directly involved with the entity, operation, function, process, system, or other subject matter&mdash;the process owner, (2) the person or group making the assessment&mdash;the internal auditor, and (3) the person or group using the assessment&mdash;the user.</p>
<p><strong>Consulting services</strong> are advisory in nature, and are generally performed at the specific request of an engagement client. The nature and scope of the consulting engagement are subject to agreement with the engagement client. Consulting services generally involve two parties: (1) the person or group offering the advice&mdash;the internal auditor, and (2) the person or group seeking and receiving the advice&mdash;the engagement client. When performing consulting services, the internal auditor should maintain objectivity and not assume management responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Standards </em>apply to individual internal auditors and internal audit activities. </strong>All internal auditors are accountable for conforming with the <em>Standards </em>related to individual objectivity, proficiency, and due professional care. In addition, internal auditors are accountable for conforming with the <em>Standards</em>, which are relevant to the performance of their job responsibilities. Chief audit executives are accountable for overall conformance with the <em>Standards</em>.</p>
<p>The review and development of the <em>Standards </em>is an ongoing process. The Internal Audit Standards Board engages in extensive consultation and discussion prior to issuing the <em>Standards</em>. This includes worldwide solicitation for public comment through the exposure draft process. All exposure drafts are posted on The IIA&rsquo;s website as well as being distributed to all IIA Institutes.</p>

<p><strong>TIP</strong>: The Glossary is presented in Appendix A.&nbsp; The content comes directly from the IIA. As we go through the materials, we will provide the text of the actual standard when we believe that is the best way to cover a topic. We will add additional notes and comments as needed, but we believe that being familiar with the text of the standards is one of the best ways to prepare for the exam. When there is actual text of a Standard or other IIA document, the text will be shown in a gray textbox.</p>

</div>
<p>The professional <em>Standards</em> consist of three types of standards listed in the Introduction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attribute Standards</li>
<li>Performance Standards</li>
<li>Implementation Standards</li>
</ol>
<h3>Attribute Standards</h3>
<p>Attribute Standards (1000&ndash;1300) are concerned with the characteristics of the organization and the parties who will be performing the auditing activities. The <strong>primary components </strong>of the Attribute Standards are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose, Authority, and Responsibility</strong> (1000)<strong> </strong>- The purpose, authority, and responsibility of the internal audit activity (IAA) should be formally defined in the internal audit charter, consistent with the <em>Standards</em>, and approved by the board.</li>
<li><strong>Independence and Objectivity</strong> (1100)<strong> </strong>- The internal audit activity must be independent and the internal auditors must be objective in performing their work.</li>
<li><strong>Proficiency and Due Professional Care</strong> (1200)<strong> </strong>- Engagement must be performed with proficiency and due professional care.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Assurance and Improvement Program</strong> (1300)<strong> </strong>- The Chief Audit Executive (CAE, the head of the IAA) must develop and maintain a quality assurance and improvement program that covers all aspects of the internal audit activity and must also continuously monitor its effectiveness. This program includes periodic internal and external quality assessments and ongoing internal monitoring. Each part of the program must be designed to help the internal auditing activity add value and improve the organization&rsquo;s operations. Furthermore, the program must provide assurance that the internal audit activity conforms to the <strong>Definition of Internal Auditing</strong>, the<strong><em> Standards</em>,</strong> and the <strong>Code of Ethics.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance Standards</h3>
<p>Performance Standards (2000&ndash;2600)<strong> </strong>describe the internal audit activities and criteria against which the performance of these services can be evaluated. The <strong>primary components </strong>of the Performance Standards are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managing the Internal Audit Activity</strong> (2000)<strong> </strong>- The CAE must effectively manage the internal audit activity to ensure that it adds value to the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Nature of Work</strong> (2100)<strong> </strong>- The internal audit activity must evaluate and contribute to the improvement of risk management, control, and governance processes using a systematic and disciplined approach.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement Planning</strong> (2200)<strong> </strong>- Internal auditors must develop and record a plan for each engagement, including the scope objectives, timing, and resource allocations.</li>
<li><strong>Performing the Engagement</strong> (2300)<strong> </strong>- Internal auditors must identify, analyze, evaluate, and record sufficient information to achieve the engagement&rsquo;s objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Communicating Results</strong> (2400)<strong> </strong>- Internal auditors must communicate the engagement results.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring Progress</strong> (2500)<strong> </strong>- The CAE must establish and maintain a system to monitor the disposition of results communicated to management.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution of Management&rsquo;s Acceptance of Risks</strong> (2600)<strong> </strong>- When the CAE believes that senior management has accepted a level of residual risk that may be unacceptable to the organization, the CAE must discuss the matter with senior management. If the decision regarding residual risk is not resolved, the CAE and senior management must report the matter to the board for resolution.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementation Standards</h3>
<p>Implementation Standards apply to the two specific types of engagements: <strong>assurance</strong> (A) or <strong>consulting</strong> (C). For example, Standard 1000 (Purpose, Authority, and Responsibility) consists of implementation standards 1000.A1 or 1000.C1, which are for assurance and consulting, respectively.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assurance services</strong> involve the internal auditor&rsquo;s objective assessment of evidence to provide an independent opinion or conclusions regarding a process, system, or other subject matter. The internal auditor determines the nature and scope of the assurance engagement. There are generally three parties involved in assurance services:
<ul>
<li><strong>The process owner</strong>, or the person or group directly involved with the process, system, or other subject matter</li>
<li><strong>The internal auditor</strong>, or the person or group making the assessment</li>
<li><strong>The user</strong>, or the person or group using the assessment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consulting services</strong> are advisory in nature and are generally performed at the specific request of an engagement client. The nature and scope of the consulting engagement are subject to agreement with the engagement client. Consulting services generally involve two parties:
<ul>
<li><strong>The internal auditor</strong>, or the person or group offering the advice</li>
<li><strong>The engagement client</strong>, or the person or group seeking and receiving the advice</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted here that the internal auditor should maintain objectivity and not assume management responsibility when performing consulting services.</p>
